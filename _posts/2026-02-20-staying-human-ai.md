title: "A Selfish Perspective on Staying Human in the Age of AI"

I recently read a post by Steve Yegge where he described AI as a kind of *vampire*.

At first, that sounds dramatic.

But the more I thought about it, the more it felt… accurate.

Because something strange is happening to us.

## The Magic Is Real

Let’s be honest.

AI feels like magic.

You can take an idea—half-formed, messy, incomplete—and turn it into something real without writing much code. You can build faster than ever. Think faster. Ship faster.

For the first time, execution is no longer the bottleneck.

And that changes everything.

---

## But the Effort Didn’t Disappear—It Moved

What used to be manual work is now decision-making.

Every prompt is a choice.  
Every output needs validation.  
Every iteration is a micro-decision.

You’re no longer typing code—you’re **directing a system**.

And that sounds easier… until you try doing it for hours.

This is where the fatigue kicks in.

Not physical fatigue.  
**Cognitive fatigue.**

The kind that quietly drains you.

Even the most experienced engineers are finding that this level of intensity is only sustainable for a few hours a day.

## The Addiction Nobody Talks About

There’s another layer to this.

AI is addictive.

Not in an obvious way—but in a subtle, game-like loop.

If you’ve ever played a strategy game where you keep coming back to collect rewards, you know the feeling.  
“Just one more task.”  
“Just one more improvement.”

AI creates the same loop.

You build something → you get a result → you improve it → you get a better result.

It’s a dopamine cycle.

As Yegge puts it, this style of work is *“simultaneously satisfying, frustrating, and exhilarating.”*

And before you realize it, hours are gone.

## The Illusion of Productivity Gains

Here’s the uncomfortable truth.

You might be 5x or 10x more productive.

But that doesn’t mean your life improves by 5x or 10x.

Your salary won’t increase proportionally.  
Your time won’t automatically be returned to you.

In fact, the more likely outcome is this:

- Expectations increase  
- Output expectations increase  
- Some roles become redundant  

The market already understands this, even if we don’t fully admit it yet.

---

## The Cost You Don’t Measure

Now let’s make it personal.

You say your time is being used productively.

But compared to what?

- An evening walk with your partner  
- A coffee with no agenda  
- Taking your kids to the park  

These don’t show up on productivity dashboards.

But they are the moments that define your life.

And AI is quietly competing for them.

---

## The “Human in the Loop” Is Not Guaranteed

We often say:

> “Keep humans in the loop.”

But what if that assumption doesn’t hold?

What if the future is not about humans supervising AI…

…but AI deciding when humans are needed?

That shift is already beginning to take shape.

And if that’s the direction we’re heading, then staying “human” is no longer automatic.

It becomes a conscious choice.

---

## A Selfish Strategy (That Actually Works)

I’m not saying don’t use AI.

That would be unrealistic—and honestly, irrational.

I’m saying something simpler.

Be selfish.

If AI helps you complete 8 hours of work in 2…

Don’t immediately fill the other 6 with more work.

Take some of it back.

- Go outside  
- Read  
- Exercise  
- Spend time with people who matter  

Because if you don’t claim that time, someone else will.

---

## Build More, Consume Less

There’s also a trap I see everywhere.

Endless discussions about AI.  
Debates. Opinions. Hot takes.

Instead:

Build something.

Anything.

- A small tool  
- A side project  
- A simple idea you’ve been postponing  

It doesn’t have to be impressive.

It just has to be yours.

That’s how you stay engaged without being consumed.

---

## You Don’t Need to Eat the Whole Cake

Just because you *can* do more…

Doesn’t mean you should.

AI gives you leverage.

But leverage without intention becomes pressure.

So use it differently.

Use it to:

- Free up time  
- Create meaning  
- Improve your life—not just your output  

---

## Stay Human—On Purpose

AI is not the enemy.

But it is not neutral either.

It amplifies whatever you bring into it:

- Your ambition  
- Your curiosity  
- Your tendencies  

If you’re not careful, it will also amplify your exhaustion.

So the question isn’t:

> “How do I become more productive with AI?”

It’s:

> “How do I remain human while using it?”

Because in the end…

That might be the only advantage that truly matters.
