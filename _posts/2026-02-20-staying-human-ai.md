A Selfish Perspective on Staying Human in the Age of AI

Feb 20, 2026

I recently read a [post](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-ai-vampire-eda6e4f07163) by Steve Yegge where he described AI as a kind of **vampire**. At first, that sounded dramatic. But the more I thought about it, the more it felt accurate. Something strange is happening to us.

### The Magic Feels Real

AI feels like magic. You can take an idea—half-formed, messy, incomplete—and turn it into something real without writing much code. You can build faster, think faster, ship faster. Execution is no longer the bottleneck — and that changes everything.

### The Fatigue You Don't Notice

But the effort didn’t disappear. It simply moved. What used to be manual work is now decision-making. Every prompt is a choice. Every output needs validation. Every iteration is a micro-decision. You’re no longer typing code — you’re directing a system. And that sounds easier… until you try doing it for hours.

This is where the fatigue sets in. Not physical fatigue, but cognitive fatigue: the kind that quietly drains you. Even the most experienced engineers find this intensity sustainable only for a few hours a day.

### The Loop That Pulls You Back

There’s another layer: AI is addictive. Not in an obvious way, but in a subtle, game-like loop. If you’ve ever played a strategy game where you keep coming back to collect rewards, you know the feeling: “Just one more task… just one more improvement.” AI creates the same cycle. You build something, get a result, improve it, get a better result. Satisfaction, frustration, exhilaration — all in one continuous flow. Hours vanish before you notice.

### The Cost of Productivity

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: you might be five or ten times more productive, but that doesn’t mean your life improves by the same factor. Your salary won’t automatically increase. Your time won’t magically return. Expectations rise. Some roles may even become redundant. The market already prices this in — even if we haven’t fully admitted it yet.

### Reclaiming Time

You might feel productive, but productive compared to what? Compared to an evening walk with your partner. A quiet coffee with no agenda. Taking your kids to the park. These moments don’t appear on dashboards, but they are the ones that truly define life. And AI is quietly competing for them.

So, what can we do? I’m not suggesting that we stop using AI — that would be unrealistic. Instead, I propose a simpler, selfish strategy. If AI helps you complete eight hours of work in two, don’t immediately fill the remaining six hours with more work. Take some time back. Go outside, read, exercise, spend time with the people who matter. Claim that time for yourself — because if you don’t, someone—or something—else will.

### Build More, Consume Less

Endless debates and hot takes about AI are tempting, but they consume energy without creating anything. Instead, build something. A small tool, a side project, a simple idea you’ve been postponing. It doesn’t have to impress anyone. It just has to be yours. That’s how you stay engaged without being consumed.

### You Don't Need to Eat the Whole Cake

Just because you can do more doesn’t mean you should. AI gives leverage, but leverage without intention becomes pressure. Use it intentionally — to free up time, create meaning, improve your life, not just your output.

### Stay Human — On Purpose

AI is not the enemy, but it’s not neutral either. It amplifies whatever you bring to it: your ambition, your curiosity, your tendencies. And if you’re not careful, it will amplify exhaustion too. So the question isn’t, “How do I become more productive with AI?” The question is, “How do I remain human while using it?” Because in the end, that might be the only advantage that truly matters.
