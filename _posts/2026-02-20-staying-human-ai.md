A Selfish Perspective on Staying Human in the Age of AI

Feb 20, 2026

I recently read a [post](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-ai-vampire-eda6e4f07163) by Steve Yegge where he described AI as a kind of **vampire**. At first, that sounded dramatic. But the more I thought about it, the more it felt accurate. Because something strange is happening to us.

AI feels like magic. You can take an idea—half-formed, messy, incomplete—and turn it into something real without writing much code. You can build faster, think faster, ship faster. Execution is no longer the bottleneck, and that changes everything.

But the effort didn’t disappear. It simply moved. What used to be manual work is now decision-making. Every prompt is a choice, every output needs validation, every iteration is a micro-decision. You’re no longer typing code—you’re directing a system. And that sounds easier… until you try doing it for hours.

This is where the fatigue sets in. Not physical fatigue, but cognitive fatigue: the kind that quietly drains you, that sits in the background while your mind races through dozens of micro-decisions. Even the most experienced engineers are finding that this level of intensity is sustainable only for a few hours a day.

There’s another layer, subtler and more insidious: AI is addictive. Not in an obvious way, but in a way that mimics the loops of a game. If you’ve ever played a strategy game where you keep returning to collect rewards, you know the feeling. “Just one more task, just one more improvement,” you tell yourself. AI creates the same loop. You build something, you get a result, you improve it, you get a better result. Satisfaction, frustration, exhilaration, all in one continuous cycle. Hours vanish before you notice.

And here’s the uncomfortable truth: productivity gains don’t automatically improve your life. You might be five or ten times more productive, but your salary won’t increase fivefold, your time won’t magically return to you, and expectations inevitably rise. Some roles may even become redundant, as the market already understands, even if we haven’t fully admitted it yet.

We often assume that our time is being used productively. But productive compared to what? Compared to an evening walk with your partner, a quiet coffee with no agenda, or taking your kids to the park. These moments don’t appear on dashboards, but they are the ones that define life. And AI is quietly competing for them.

The idea of “human in the loop” is no longer guaranteed. We often say that humans will supervise AI, keep the loop active. But what if that assumption doesn’t hold? What if the future isn’t about humans supervising AI, but about AI deciding whether humans are even needed? That shift is already beginning, and if it continues, staying human will no longer be automatic. It will become a conscious choice.

So, what can we do? I’m not suggesting that we stop using AI. That would be unrealistic—and frankly, irrational. Instead, I propose a simpler, selfish strategy. If AI helps you complete eight hours of work in two, don’t immediately fill the remaining six hours with more work. Take some time back. Go outside, read, exercise, spend time with the people who matter. Claim that time for yourself, because if you don’t, someone—or something—else will.

There’s another trap: endless discussions about AI, debates, hot takes. They’re tempting, but they consume energy without creating anything. Instead, build something. A small tool, a side project, a simple idea you’ve been postponing. It doesn’t have to impress anyone. It just has to be yours. That’s how you stay engaged without being consumed.

Just because you can do more doesn’t mean you should. AI gives leverage, but leverage without intention becomes pressure. Use it intentionally—to free up time, create meaning, improve your life, not just your output.

AI is not the enemy. But it is not neutral either. It amplifies what you bring to it: your ambition, your curiosity, your tendencies. And if you’re not careful, it will amplify exhaustion as well. So the question isn’t “how do I become more productive with AI?” The question is, “how do I remain human while using it?” Because in the end, that might be the only advantage that truly matters.
